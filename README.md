#Dell Warranty API Script v0.01    

This script is a fork of Hull1 Dell Warranty API.

This Dell Warranty API script makes use of Dell's new OAuth 2.0 Authentication for ALL API Keys. If you want to use this script, you will need to request an API Key from the Dell TechDirect portal.

I have added functionality to the script.

The script now prompts you if you would like to have the data exported to a .csv file. The file it exports to is modelled to work directly with Asset Managers or any Asset Tracking program through importing.

The script also includes a GUI for PowerShell using WPF. The GUI will open when the script is ran and prompts you for a list of Service Tags (Comma separated) and the Dell TechDirect API Key and Client secret.
