Dell Warranty API Script v0.01    

This script is a fork of Hull1 Dell Warranty API.

I have added functionality to the script.

The script now prompts you if you would like to have the data exported to a .csv file. The file it exports to is modelled to work directly with Asset Managers or any Asset Tracking program through importing.

The script also includes a GUI for PowerShell using WPF. The GUI will open when the script is ran and prompts you for a list of Service Tags (Comma separated) and the Dell TechDirect API Key and Client secret.
